For general information on the project please refer to our guides on the [website](https://www.expresslrs.org/), and our [FAQ](https://www.expresslrs.org/2.0/faq/)

## About

ExpressLRS is an open source Radio Link for Radio Control applications. Designed to be the best FPV Racing link, it is based on the fantastic Semtech **SX127x**/**SX1280** LoRa hardware combined with an Espressif or STM32 Processor. Using LoRa modulation as well as reduced packet size it achieves best in class range and latency. It achieves this using a highly optimized over-the-air packet structure, giving simultaneous range and latency advantages. It supports both 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz links, each with their own benefits. 900 MHz supports a maximum of 200 Hz packet rate, with higher penetration. 2.4 GHz supports a blistering fast 1000 Hz on [EdgeTX](http://edgetx.org/). With hundreds of different hardware targets from a wide range of hardware manufacturers, the choice of hardware is constantly growing, with different hardware suited to different requirements.

## Configurator
To configure your ExpressLRS hardware, the ExpressLRS Configurator can be used, which is found here:

https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS-Configurator/releases/

## Community
We have both a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/expresslrs) and [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/636441730280366), which have great support for new users and constant ongoing development discussion

## Features

ExpressLRS has the following features:

- Up to 1000 Hz Packet Rate
- Telemetry (Betaflight Lua Compatibility)
- Wifi Updates
- Bluetooth or WiFi Sim Joystick
- Oled & TFT Displays
- 2.4 GHz, 900 MHz, and Dual-Band RC Link
- SMD Antenna - allows for easier installation into micros
- Supported receiver protocols: CRSF, SBUS, SUMD, and PWM
- VTX and VRX Frequency adjustments from the Lua
- Bind Phrases - no need for button binding

with many more features on the way!

## Supported Hardware

ExpressLRS currently supports hardware from a wide range of manufacturers. In principle, the targets listed in the [ExpressLRS Configurator](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS-Configurator/releases/) are tested and supported hardware.

Please refer to the [Hardware Selection] page (https://www.expresslrs.org/hardware/hardware-selection/) on the website for guidance. We do not manufacture any of our hardware, so we can only provide limited support for faulty hardware.
