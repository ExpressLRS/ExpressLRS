### The Legal Stuff ###

# The use and operation of this type of device may require a license and some countries may forbid its use entirely.
# It is entirely up to the end user to ensure compliance with local regulations. No claim of regulatory compliance is made. In most cases a HAM license is required.
# This is experimental software/hardware and there is no guarantee of stability or reliability. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

### BINDING PHRASE: ###

### PERFORMANCE OPTIONS: ###

#unlocks >250mw output power for R9M and Happy Model ES915TX (Fan mod suggested: https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS/wiki/R9M-Fan-Mod-Cover)

### COMPATIBILITY OPTIONS: ###

# Invert the TX/RX half-duplex pin in the transmitter code. Handset external
# modules are almost all inverted. ESP32 targets only
-DUART_INVERTED

# Invert the TX pin in the receiver code to allow an inverted RX pin on the
# FC to be used (usually labeled SBUS input or RXI). Inverted CRSF output.
# RX pin (telemetry) is unaffected. Update via_BetaflightPassthrough will 
# not work, only via_Wifi. ESP8266/8285 targets only
#-DRCVR_INVERT_TX

# Use the SBUS **pin** on R9MM receiver hardware, which is inverted.
# Does not output SBUS protocol, just inverted CRSF.

# Use DEBUG_LOG_VERBOSE instead (or both) to see verbose debug logging (spammy stuff)
