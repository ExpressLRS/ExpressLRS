#### The Legal Stuff ###
# The use and operation of this type of device may require a license and some countries may forbid its use entirely.
# It is entirely up to the end user to ensure compliance with local regulations. No claim of regulatory compliance is made. In most cases a HAM license is required. 
# This is experimental software/hardware and there is no guarantee of stability or reliability. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK 


# This file can be used to pass defines for compiler
#
# Purpose is mainly to define user specific variables
# without modifying the actual source codes. These
# flags are passed for all build targets.
#
# Define need to start with '-D' keyword
#

### STEP1: ### 
### Enable one of these regulatory domains by removing a leading '#' ###

#-DRegulatory_Domain_AU_915
#-DRegulatory_Domain_EU_868
#-DRegulatory_Domain_AU_433
#-DRegulatory_Domain_EU_433
#-DRegulatory_Domain_FCC_915

### Bands for SX1280 (2400MHz) ###
#-DRegulatory_Domain_ISM_2400

### STEP2: ### 
### DEFINE ONE AND ONLY ONE OF THE SWITCH ENCODING OPTIONS ##
# The TX and RX must be compiled with matching switch protocols!
# If neither of the below are set the code defaults to 1bit switches

#-DSEQ_SWITCHES

# Sequential switches
# 5 bits are used in each rc packet to encode 8 3 position switches
# first 3 bits are the switch ID, followed by 2 bits for the switch value.
# Switches that have changed are given priority, otherwise each switch value
# is sent in round-robin.
# Channel 4 is reduced to 10bit resolution in order to get the 5th bit needed
# for sequential switch encoding.

#-DHYBRID_SWITCHES_8

# Hybrid switches
# The first switch is treated as a low-latency switch to be used for arm/disarm.
# It is sent with every packet. The remaining 7 switch channels are sent
# in the same change-prioritized round-robin fashion as described for sequential
# switches above. All switches are encoded for 3 position support. All analog
# channels are reduced to 10bit resolution to free up space in the rc packet
# for switches.

### STEP3: ### 
### Set your custom binding phrase here. This unique string is used to pair your ExpressLRS tx and rx. ###
-DMY_BINDING_PHRASE="default ExpressLRS binding phrase"

### OTHER OPTIONS: ### 
# No sync on arm, don't transmit sync packet when armed (if using a different arm channel you NEED to edit, default is AUX1 (Channel 5).
# This is useful if you are a racer and want the best possible RC link (no packets wasted on sending sync packets), this is not reconmened for LR as complete 
# and sustained RXloss will require you to disarm to regain link. 
#-DNO_SYNC_ON_ARM
#-DARM_CHANNEL=AUX1

#Use OpenTX packet sync feature (requires OpenTX 2.4 onwards) - this reduces latency.
-DFEATURE_OPENTX_SYNC
# Automatically calculate the safe offset for OpenTXsync (needs OpenTX 2.4 or later)
#-DFEATURE_OPENTX_SYNC_AUTOTUNE
 
 # Serial connection to module is inverted by default, uninvert (comment out by #) for some radios eg T8SG V2
-DUART_INVERTED

# Wifi starts if no connection is found between 10 and 11 seconds after boot (for ESP8285 Modules)
-DAUTO_WIFI_ON_BOOT

# Beep only once (applies to TX modules with buzzer)
#-DJUST_BEEP_ONCE

# Uncomment to use UART2 for MSP comms on the TX module
-DUSE_UART2

#ESP8266 Backpack is a debugging tool mainly for use with R9M, most users will not have it
#-DUSE_ESP8266_BACKPACK

# Uncomment to use the inverted sbus pad on the r9mm receiver and flight controller.  'set serialrx_inverted = ON' may also need to be set within Betaflight.
# TLM is not available.  Flashing via the BetaflightPassthrough target will not work!!!
#-DUSE_R9MM_R9MINI_SBUS

# RF Mode Locking - Default mode is for the Rx to cycle through the available RF modes and find
# which mode the Tx transmitting.  LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION allows the Rx to cycle, but once a connection
# is made the Rx will no longer cycle through the RF modes.  LOCK_ON_50HZ sets the Rx to only 50Hz
# mode from the powerup.
#-DLOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION
#-DLOCK_ON_50HZ
