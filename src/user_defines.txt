### The Legal Stuff ###

# The use and operation of this type of device may require a license and some countries may forbid its use entirely.
# It is entirely up to the end user to ensure compliance with local regulations. No claim of regulatory compliance is made. In most cases a HAM license is required.
# This is experimental software/hardware and there is no guarantee of stability or reliability. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

### BINDING PHRASE: ###
# Uncomment the line below to use a hardcoded binding phrase
# Leave commented to use traditional binding
#-DMY_BINDING_PHRASE="default ExpressLRS binding phrase"


### REGULATORY DOMAIN: ###

# Domain is used to define correct frequency band for 900MHz hardware.

#-DRegulatory_Domain_EU_868
#-DRegulatory_Domain_IN_866

### PERFORMANCE OPTIONS: ###

#unlocks >250mw output power for R9M and Happy Model ES915TX (Fan mod suggested: https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS/wiki/R9M-Fan-Mod-Cover)
#-DUNLOCK_HIGHER_POWER

-DLOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION

# For TX devices with fans, FAN_MIN_RUNTIME keeps the fan running even after the power level has
# dropped below the configured Fan Threshold. This prevents the fan from turning on and off every
# few seconds if the power level is constantly changing.
# Default is 30 seconds if not defined, value can be 0-254.
#-DFAN_MIN_RUNTIME=30

### COMPATIBILITY OPTIONS: ###

# Invert the TX/RX half-duplex pin in the transmitter code. Handset external
# modules are almost all inverted. ESP32/8286 targets only
-DUART_INVERTED

# Use a custom baud rate on the receiver for a KISS v1 FC (which runs at 400000) or any other oddball baud
# If not defined, will default to 420000
#-DRCVR_UART_BAUD=400000

# Invert the TX pin in the receiver code to allow an inverted RX pin on the
# FC to be used (usually labeled SBUS input or RXI). Inverted CRSF output.
# RX pin (telemetry) is unaffected. Update via_BetaflightPassthrough will
# not work, only via_Wifi. ESP8266/8285 targets only
#-DRCVR_INVERT_TX

#-DTLM_REPORT_INTERVAL_MS=240LU

### OTHER OPTIONS: ###

-DAUTO_WIFI_ON_INTERVAL=60
#-DHOME_WIFI_SSID=""
#-DHOME_WIFI_PASSWORD=""

# Enables code for talking to a connected ESP8266 backpack on the TX module, and associated Lua params
# The device target should enable this automatically for devices that come with this, but can be added
# to any device.
#-DUSE_TX_BACKPACK

# Silence the buzzer
#-DDISABLE_ALL_BEEPS
# Disables the startup tune and crsf connect/disconnct do beep-boop
#-DDISABLE_STARTUP_BEEP
# Startup is beep-boop, and crsf connect/disconnct do similar
#-DJUST_BEEP_ONCE
# Startup plays you own custom tune and crsf connect/disconnct do beep-boop
#-DMY_STARTUP_MELODY="B5 16 P16 B5 16 P16 B5 16 P16 B5 2 G5 2 A5 2 B5 8 P4 A5 8 B5 1|140|-3"

#If commented out the LED is RGB otherwise GRB

### Debugging options ###

# Turn on debug messages, if disabled then all debugging options (starting with DEBUG_) are disabled
#-DDEBUG_LOG
# Use DEBUG_LOG_VERBOSE instead (or both) to see verbose debug logging (spammy stuff)
#-DDEBUG_LOG_VERBOSE

# Print a letter for each packet received or missed (RX debugging)
#-DDEBUG_RX_SCOREBOARD

# Don't send RC msgs over UART
#-DDEBUG_CRSF_NO_OUTPUT

# These debugging options send extra information to BetaFlight in the LinkStatistics packet
#-DDEBUG_BF_LINK_STATS

# Prints a log line for every channels packet recieved at the RX:
#    ID,Antenna,RSSI,LQ,SNR,PWR,FHSS,TimingOffset
# The ID is generated on the TX side and overwrites CH1-CH4 and increments once for every
# channels packet. Writes directly to Serial, does not require DEBUG_LOG.
# Flash both TX & RX with this enbled to use it if the ID is required.
#-DDEBUG_RCVR_LINKSTATS

# Enable reporting of RF FreqCorrection in RX's SNR LinkStatistics, also decreases packet rate
# on Team2.4 for the additional time needed to include the packet header / enable FreqCorrection
# Dynamic power must be off, else it will adjust based on the FreqCorrection reported in SNR
#-DDEBUG_FREQ_CORRECTION

# Enable reporting offsets sent to Open/EdgeTX for packet synchronisation.
# Also logs forced resyncs when a packet is delayed or missed.
#-DDEBUG_OPENTX_SYNC

# Use an ELRS TX and RX as a transparent UART over the air
#-DUSE_AIRPORT_AT_BAUD=9600
