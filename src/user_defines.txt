#
# This file can be used to pass defines for compiler
#
# Purpose is mainly to define user specific variables
# without modifying the actual source codes. These
# flags are passed for all build targets.
#
# Define need to start with '-D' keyword
#

### STEP1: ### 
### Enable one of these regulatory domains ###

### Bands for SX1276 (900MHz) ###
#-DRegulatory_Domain_AU_915
#-DRegulatory_Domain_EU_868
#-DRegulatory_Domain_AU_433
#-DRegulatory_Domain_EU_433
#-DRegulatory_Domain_FCC_915

### Bands for SX1280 (2400MHz) ###
-DRegulatory_Domain_ISM_2400

### STEP2: ### 
### DEFINE ONE AND ONLY ONE OF THE SWITCH ENCODING OPTIONS ##
# The TX and RX must be compiled with matching switch protocols!
# If neither of the below are set the code defaults to 1bit switches

#-DSEQ_SWITCHES

# Sequential switches
# 5 bits are used in each rc packet to encode 8 3 position switches
# first 3 bits are the switch ID, followed by 2 bits for the switch value.
# Switches that have changed are given priority, otherwise each switch value
# is sent in round-robin.
# Channel 4 is reduced to 10bit resolution in order to get the 5th bit needed
# for sequential switch encoding.

#-DHYBRID_SWITCHES_8

# Hybrid switches
# The first switch is treated as a low-latency switch to be used for arm/disarm.
# It is sent with every packet. The remaining 7 switch channels are sent
# in the same change-prioritized round-robin fashion as described for sequential
# switches above. All switches are encoded for 3 position support. All analog
# channels are reduced to 10bit resolution to free up space in the rc packet
# for switches.

### STEP3: ### 
### Set your custom UID here. Use 6 random bytes! ###
-DMY_UID=0xBA,0xBE,0xCA,0xFE,0xAC,0xDC
#-DMY_UID=180,230,45,234,66,4

### OTHER OPTIONS: ### 

-DAuto_WiFi_On_Boot   # Wifi starts if no connection is found between 10 and 11 seconds after boot (for ESP8285 Modules)

-DJUST_BEEP_ONCE     #B eep only once (applies to TX modules with buzzer)

-DUSE_UART2    # Uncomment to use UART2 for MSP comms on the TX module

-DUSE_ESP8266_BACKPACK
