`elrs.lua` works with all versions of ExpressLRS from v2.0 to current. There is no requirement to use an e.g. elrsV3.lua for 3.x, just use elrs.lua.

## Old ELRS.lua

When copying the lua to you handset, delete any old versions such as ELRS.lua, elrsV2.lua, or elrsV3.lua. The version-labeled filenames have been obsoleted.
